<h1 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance"><a>Customizing Editing Behavior</a>
</h1>


<p>WebEQ Editor allows you to customize several aspects of its
user interface.  This is done from the Preferences | General Editing
dialog.</p>



<idxentry xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance"></idxentry>

<h2 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">Changing the Toolbar</h2>


<p>The Toolbar pulldown menu lets you select between
several standard pre-defined toolbar configurations by using the
pulldown menu on the left.</p>



<p><img src="images/preferences4.gif"></p>



<p>You can also load a custom toolbar from a toolbar configuration file. To do
  this, choose "custom" from the pulldown, which then activates the input field
  for a toolbar configuration file. Enter the path to your toolbar configuration
  file.</p>

<h2 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">Changing Spacebar Behavior</h2>


<p>In editing MathML, the need to insert an InvisibleTimes character is
extremely common.  Since MathML groups runs of characters into tokens,
just typing "xy" leads to a single two-character token, typeset
in an upright font.  However, what you probably meant was "x
InvisibleTimes y" typeset as two single-character tokens in an italic
font.</p>



<p>To make entering InvisibleTimes more convenient, WebEQ Editor
gives you several options for the spacebar behavior.</p>



<DL xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">
<DT><b>Invisible times after an operand, space otherwise</b></DT>

<dd>This is the default behavior. This takes some getting used to, but
is quite handy.  Most of the time, the default is correct.  When it
isn't, you can use the following tricks:

<p>Forcing a space --  Note that if you hit the spacebar twice, you
will always get a true space character the second time, since the
first character (InvisibleTimes or space) is never an operand.
So if you want a space where the default was InvisibleTimes, you hit
spacebar twice to get 'InvisibleTimes', ' ' and then backspace over
the InvisibleTimes.</p>



<p>Forcing an InvisibleTimes -- If you need an InvisibleTimes
when space is the default, insert it from the invisible characters
palette on the standard toolbar.</p>


</dd>


<dt><b>Invisible times always</b></dt>


<dd>This option gives you control over where the invisible times
markers are placed.  However, for most people, it is hard to refrain
from automatically hitting the space bar at times, so it is also
dangerous. To get a true space character, use the invisible character
palette on the standard toolbar.
</dd>


<dt><b>Space always</b></dt>


<dd>This is usually not a good idea unless you only care about the
appearance of the equations.  To get an invisible times character, use
the invisible character palette on the standard toolbar.
</dd>


<dt><b>Nothing</b></dt>

<dd>If you prefer, you can turn off the spacebar entirely, and use the
invisible character palette on the standard toolbar for both space and
InvisibleTimes characters.</dd>


</DL>

<h2 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">Changing Parentheses Behavior</h2>

<p>MathML specifies that by default parentheses stretch vertically to
surround the tallest item in the same template slot with them.  As a
side effect, this behavior forces you to be more conscious of putting
in the proper group for the mathematical structure of an equation.
However, many authors are more comfortable with parentheses that don't
stretchy unless they tell them to.</p>



<p>If you set your preference to non-stretchy parentheses, parens won't
stretch unless you edit their operator properties, and manually set the
stretchy property to true.  Also, the parentheses in the parentheses
template from the standard toolbar are always stretchy regardless of
this setting.

<idxentry xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance"></idxentry>


<H2 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">Changing Auto-italic Behavior</H2>

<p>MathML specifies that the default font for single character
identifiers is italic, while for multi-character identifiers the
default is upright.  This is extremely convenient for mathematics
where this guideline is almost always followed.  However, this is not
the case in other disciplines, notably chemistry.
Therefore, you can choose whether single character identifiers are
to be set in italics by default.</p>



<p>Sometimes it is desirable to not automatically italicize uppercase
Greek letters, even if auto-italic behavior is selected.  There is
an option to choose whether uppercase Greek letters should be normal
by default. Even if auto-italic behavior is checked, uppercase Greek
letters can be made normal (in effect overriding the auto-italic behavior).</p>



<p>Regardless of these settings, you can always change the font by
manually setting the logical font property in a token's font
properties dialog. </p>

<H2 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">Changing Auto-recognize Functions Behavior</H2>


<p>WebEQ Editor has two modes for determining how keystrokes should be 
interpreted.  In the default mode where auto-recognition of functions is enabled, 
each keystroke is assumed to be a separate 
variable, number or operator.  Thus, typing 'x','y','z' will be interpreted as
individual variables (&lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;y&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;z&lt;/mi&gt; in the MathML markup) 
and typeset in italics accordingly.  At the same time,
the WebEQ Editor scans the equation for common elementary function names, such as 
'sin' and 'log'.  When it sees these functions, it automatically merges the characters 
into a single function name and typesets the result in an upright serif font.  This mode 
produces the best results for most users, and will be familiar to users of Design Science
Equation Editor and MathType.</p>



<p>Some users that want to have explicit control over how keyboard data is tokenized into
MathML elements may wish to turn auto-recognition of functions off.  In this mode, number and
alphabetic characters from the keyboard are all placed in the same MathML token element.  To
start a new token, the user must insert a new element, usually by inserting an "invisible 
times" character via the spacebar.  Thus, in this mode, typing 'x', 'y', 'z' produces a single
identifier (&lt;mi&gt;xyz&lt;/mi&gt; in the MathML) typeset in an upright serif font.  To obtain
the italic variables multiplied together, one would need to type 'x', spacebar, 'y', spacebar, 'z'.
Most users do not need or desire this level of control over markup, but from time to time it 
it still useful for modifying equations where the results of auto-function recognition are not
what was desired.</p>

<H2 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">Changing Differential D Rendering Behavior</H2>


<p>MathML uses a special "differential d" character to indicate differentiation. This
semantic hint is valuable for properly interpreting MathML in a computer algebra system.
In particular, Mathematica<sup xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">tm</sup>
 has introduced the convention of using a doublestruck
(or openface) font to render the diffferential d character.  In some situations, authors may
wish to follow this convention by enabling the "use double struck differential d" option.  By
default, this option is disabled, and the differential d character will display with a normal
serif d, as is more traditional in mathematical typesetting.</p>
