	<idxentry xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance"></idxentry>

	<p>MathML can describe an equation in two ways.  
<em xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">Presentation markup</em> describes the way an equation
should look, and <em xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">Content markup</em> describes what an equation
means.  Ordinarily, editing an equation is a process of getting its
appearance to look right, and so by default, WebEQ Editor
generates a presentation markup of an equation in progress.</p>


	<p>Once you finish your equation, you can have WebEQ Editor apply
algorithms to try to infer the mathematical meaning of your equation, and generate a content markup description.  To do this,</p>


	<ol xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">
		<li>Check that WebEQ Editor is able to generate content markup for the
current equation by clicking the <b>check syntax</b> button on the
toolbar as described below.</li>

		<li>Change your <a href="mmlprefs.html#mmlprefs">MathML Export Preferences</a>
to indicate that WebEQ Editor should generate content markup.</li>

		<li>Use the <b>Save As MathML</b> option on the <a href="filemenu.html#filemenu">File Menu</a> or the <b>Copy MathML</b> option from
<a href="copyas.html#copyas">Copy Special</a> submenu of the Edit Menu.</li>

	</ol>

	<p>As a convenience, whenever you click the <b xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">check syntax</b> button and the 
current equation passes the check, WebEQ Editor automatically places
content markup for the equation on the clipboard using the current
export preferences for namespaces.</p>


	<idxentry xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance"></idxentry>

	<h2 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">Checking Syntax</h2>

	<p>Two broad problems areas can cause WebEQ Editor's content
markup generation algorithms to fail.</p>


	<ol xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">
		<li>The equation can be too complicated to be represented as content
markup.  Content markup can only represent fairly elementary expressions.</li>

		<li>There can be problems with the equation that
prevent the WebEQ algorithms from inferring the proper mathematical
meaning.</li>

	</ol>

	<p>To assist in diagnosing these problems, you can check your equation
by clicking the check mark button on the far right of the standard
toolbar.  This will highlight parts of your equation, giving you
visual feedback about any problems with the way in which the equation is
being interpreted, as illustrated here:</p>


	<p>
		<img src="images/contentgen9.gif">
	</p>


	<p>You can toggle back and forth between syntax highlighting and
regular display by clicking the check mark button again.  Also,
starting to edit will revert the equation to normal mode.</p>


	<p>If there are obvious problems with your equation, WebEQ Editor will
display an error message in the editor status line, and highlight the
template where the error was detected in blinking red.</p>


	<idxentry xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance"></idxentry>

	<p>So long as you don't see any errors, WebEQ Editor is
generating <em xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">some</em> content markup encoding of your equation.
However, you should always look carefully to be sure that there aren't
any subtle errors in the translation, such as extra invisible
multiplications.</p>


	<p>The colors of symbols in a highlighted expression denote the roles
the content generation algorithm thinks they play in your equation.
The color codes are as follows:</p>


	<table xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<td>
					<b>Color</b>
				</td>

				<td>
					<b>Syntactic Role</b>
				</td>

			</tr>

		</thead>

		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>red</td>

				<td>operator</td>

			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td>blue</td>

				<td>operand</td>

			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td>green</td>

				<td>function</td>

			</tr>

		</tbody>

	</table>

	<h2 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">Limitations of Content Markup</h2>

	<p>Not all equations can be described in equation markup.  For
example, in presentation markup, it is fine to type "1 + 2 -".  This
is just a sequence of symbols as far as its appearance is concerned.
However, from a mathematical viewpoint, this is an unfinished
expression that doesn't have a well-defined meaning.</p>


	<p>If you tried to use WebEQ Editor to generate content markup for this equation, 
it would
warn you that it couldn't since the "-" operator expects something to
the right of it.  You could only generate content markup by completing
a mathematically meaningful expression, say "1 + 2 - 3".  </p>


	<idxentry xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance"></idxentry>

	<p>See the WebEQ Developers Suite documentation for a fuller discussion of the issues
that can arise that prevent proper content markup generation.</p>
