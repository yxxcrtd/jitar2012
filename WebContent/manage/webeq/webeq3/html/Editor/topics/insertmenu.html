<idxentry xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance"></idxentry>


<p>Templates play a central role in MathML.  The choice of templates
and the way in which templates are nested determine both how the
equation will appear, and how easily its mathematical meaning can be
inferred by algorithms. Understanding a few basic principles about
MathML templates will help you get the most out of WebEQ Editor.</p>



<p>Templates can be inserted from the <a href="toolbar.html#toolbar">Toolbar</a>, using <a href="keyboard.html#keyboard">Keyboard
Shortcuts</a>, or from the Insert Menu, as described in the
following sections.  Although most templates are available from the toolbar,
templates for interactive equations, matrices of
any dimension, style changes, and a few other less common MathML templates
are only available from the Insert Menu.</p>

<p>Templates are always inserted at the current
cursor location.</p>

<h2 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">Expression Groups</h2>

<idxentry xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance"></idxentry>


<p>In general, MathML expects authors to try to group expressions
together in rough accordance with the mathematical meaning of the
expression.   As a consequence, the <b xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">Expression Group</b> template
is extremely important (available on the Insert Layout submenu of the
Insert Menu, or from the ctrl-r keyboard shortcut).</p>


<idxentry xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance"></idxentry>


<p>An expression group basically acts like an invisible set of
parentheses for purposes of clarifying the mathematical structure.
Human readers often rely on clues from the surrounding context to
guess which parts of an expression go together.  Automatic algorithms,
however, need more help.  For example, many problems that arise in <a href="contentgen.html#contentgen">content generation</a> can be solved by explicitly
grouping operators and operands with expression groups.</p>

<h2 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance"><a id="stretchysymbols"></a>Controlling Stretchy Symbols</h2>

<idxentry xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance"></idxentry>


<p>Expression groups also control how symbols stretch.  There are many
kinds of mathematical symbols that can stretch -- parentheses,
brackets, braces, arrows, etc.  In authoring equations, you frequently
need to control whether these characters stretch and by how much.</p>


<idxentry xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance"></idxentry>

<idxentry xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance"></idxentry>


<p>In MathML, stretchy symbols automatically grow to cover the other
expressions <em xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">in the same template</em>.  Thus, for example, to
control the stretching of parentheses, you will frequently need to
insert extra expression group templates in order to insure that 
the parentheses and the expression they surround are alone in a
template.  Otherwise, the parentheses may unexpectedly grow to match
the height of some other part of the equation.  This is illustrated
below.  The first set of nested parentheses are contained in an expression group, 
while the second set is not:</p>

<h2 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">Cut and Paste Artifacts</h2>


<p>Most MathML templates have a specific number of blank slots.  For
example a superscript has two -- a base and a script.  To put multiple 
characters into either slot, it is necessary to wrap them in an
expression group template.  It is then the expression group which
fills the script slot, not the individual characters.</p>


<idxentry xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance"></idxentry>


<p>WebEQ Editor can often automatically group and un-group
expressions as necessary when performing cut and paste operations.
However, in many situations, this is not possible.  As a consequence,
it is easy to accidently introduce erroneous expression groups in
surprising places.  For example, it may frequently happen that one or
two characters in the middle of an expression may end up grouped as
the result of cut and paste, which makes further editing awkward.</p>



<p>The best defense against inappropriate grouping is to learn to
notice the gray cursor box that outlines the template in which the
cursor is currently located (See <a href="navigation.html#navigation">Cursor
Navigation</a> for illustrations).  The <a href="ancestry.html#ancestry">MathML
Ancestry</a> is also useful for examining the MathML template
structure for inappropriate groups.</p>
