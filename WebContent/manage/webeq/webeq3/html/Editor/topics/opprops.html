<h1 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">Operator Properties Dialog</h1>

<idxentry xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance"></idxentry>


<p>The Operator Properties dialog gives you away to control 
properties that effect the layout of MathML operators.  In MathML, the
term "operator" is more general than the ordinary mathematical concept
of an operator.  A MathML operator is basically any bit of notation
that <em xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">renders</em> like an operator.  MathML operators include not
only normal mathematical operators such as +, -, integrals, etc. but
also notations such as parentheses and braces, since all stretchy symbols 
are "operators" in MathML.</p>



<p>The effect of each MathML operator property is described
discussed below.</p>



<h2 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">Operator Spacing Properties</h2>


<h3 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">Form</h3>

<idxentry xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance"></idxentry>

<idxentry xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance"></idxentry>


<p>The <b xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">form</b> property is used to designate an operator as
'prefix', 'infix' or 'postfix'.  By default, this
property is set to <em xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">automatic</em>, and in almost all cases, this
will produce the best results.</p>



<p>In a few cases, explicitly setting the form can effect the spacing
around an operator.  Specifically, prefix and postfix operators have
less space between themselves and their operands than the infix
version of the operator.  This is most noticeable in the case of a
unary minus.  However, if you find yourself needing to set the form
for a minus sign because the automatic setting isn't giving the
desired result, chances are good that something is wrong with the
nesting structure of your templates.  
</p>



<h3 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">Space to left/right of operator</h3>

<idxentry xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance"></idxentry>

<idxentry xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance"></idxentry>


<p>These two spacing properties determine the amount of white space to
the left and right of an operator.  The default value is
<em xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">automatic</em>, which sets the spacing around an operator
to roughly reflect it's precedence; high precedence operators are
generally closer to
their operands than low precedence operators.</p>



<p>These attributes should normally only be set to achieve special
effects, or to tweak the appearance of an equation when operators are
being used in a non-standard way.  These properties can be set to any
non-negative <a href="propvals.html#sizeval">size value</a>.</p>



<h2 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">Stretchy Operator Properties</h2>

<idxentry xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance"></idxentry>


<p>The next four properties control the behavior of operators that
stretch.  Operators that stretch include "fence" characters such as
(,),[,],{,}, and |.  Some arrows also stretch, as do some
mathematical accent characters such as an overbar or a tilde.</p>



<p>The default value for all of these properties is
<em xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">automatic</em>, and except for rare situations, this will give the
best results.  The most common case where any of these properties need
to be explicitly set is to turn off stretching for a normally stretchy
character.</p>



<p>In general, a stretchy operator will shrink or <a href="insertmenu.html#stretchysymbols">grow to match the size of the enclosing
template</a>.  The following properties modify that behavior.</p>



<h3 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">Max/Min size</h3>

<idxentry xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance"></idxentry>

<idxentry xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance"></idxentry>

<idxentry xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance"></idxentry>

<idxentry xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance"></idxentry>


<p>The <b xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">min size</b> and <b xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">max size</b> control the maximum and
minimum amount a stretchy operator is allowed to stretch.  They can be
set to any non-negative <a href="propvals.html#sizeval">size value</a>.  The
max size property can also be set to the keyword 'infinity'.</p>



<h3 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">Allow stretching</h3>

<idxentry xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance"></idxentry>


<p>This true or false property determines whether an operator should
stretch or not.  While setting this property to 'false' for a
normally stretchy operators will prevent it from stretching, setting
it to 'true' will generally have no effect on a non-stretching
operator.</p>



<h3 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">Stretch symmetrically</h3>

<idxentry xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance"></idxentry>

<idxentry xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance"></idxentry>


<p>Most stretchy operators, such as parentheses, stretch symmetrically
about the centerline of the equation.  In some cases, such as a
rectangular matrix that is not aligned symmetrically, you would prefer
that the surrounding parentheses stretch asymmetrically to match the
matrix.</p>



<p><img src="images/oppropsym.gif"></p>



<p>The default value for this property is <em xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">automatic</em>.
Typically the only reason to set this property explicitly is to set it
to 'false' in cases such as that illustrated above.</p>



<h2 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">Context-related Operator Properties</h2>


<p>There are several families of MathML operators whose typographic
properties vary depending on the surrounding context.  The most
obvious example is the summation operator, where the limits of
summation are usually placed above and below the summation symbol 
in equations that are centered and set off from the text, and place in
the sub- and superscript postions in equations that appear inline.</p>



<p>The following three properties control context-sensitive behaviors
of MathML operators.</p>



<h3 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">Enlarge in display style</h3>

<idxentry xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance"></idxentry>

<idxentry xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance"></idxentry>


<p>Operators such as the summations, integrals, direct sums, etc. have
both a small inline version and a larger version for display equations.
This property controls whether the large form of these operators
should be automatically used in <a href="layoutprops.html#displaystyle">display
style</a> contexts. The default value is <em xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">automatic</em>.</p>



<h3 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">Move limits to script positions in inline style</h3>

<idxentry xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance"></idxentry>

<idxentry xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance"></idxentry>


<p>When typesetting operators that have limits,
there is a choice whether to put them above and below the
operator, or in the script positions.  As a general rule, limits go
above and below in equations in <a href="layoutprops.html#displaystyle">display style</a> contexts where vertical space
is not an issue.  When equations are set inline, however, it is
usually better to keep vertical spacing to a minimum, so as to affect
inter-line spacing as little as possible.  Thus, it is tradition to put
limits in the script positions for inline equations.</p>



<p>This property tells a MathML renderer whether to
automatically shift limits into the script positions, when it detects
that an equation is inline.  Setting the property to 'false'
will result in limits always being set above and below the operator.
The default value is <em xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">automatic</em>.</p>



<h3 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance"><a id="opaccentprop"></a>Treat as an accent for positioning</h3>

<idxentry xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance"></idxentry>

<idxentry xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance"></idxentry>


<p>When typesetting overscripts and underscripts, the usual practice
is to use a smaller type face.  However, when typesetting mathematical
accents, such as a tilde or a bar, as an overscript, you typically
want the font size of the accent to match the size of the character to
which it is attached.  By setting this property to 'true' you
can instruct MathML renderers not to decrease the font size for an
operator when it is being typeset as a script.  The default value is
<em xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">automatic</em>.</p>
