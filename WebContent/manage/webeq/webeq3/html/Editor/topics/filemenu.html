	<p>Saving and opening files is accomplished through the File Menu.</p>


	<p></p>


	<p>The four basic options on the File menu are:</p>


	<dl xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">
		<dt>
			<b>New</b>
		</dt>

		<dd>Selecting New clears the current equation and starts a new blank
equation.  If you have modified the current equation since the last
save, you will be asked whether you wish to save your changes.
<idxentry></idxentry>

		</dd>

		<dt>
			<b>Open MathML</b>
		</dt>

		<dd>This option loads a saved equation into the
Editor.  The editor can open any valid MathML equation.  When you open
an equation encoded as content MathML in WebEQ Editor, the visual
appearance may be slightly different than you are expecting, since
content MathML only encodes the meaning of an equation.  In some
instances, MathML created by third-party tools may not open
correctly because of XML directives that WebEQ Editor doesn't
understand, such as processing instructions and doctype declarations.
In these cases, remove the additional XML directives with a text
editor before opening the equation with WebEQ Editor.
<idxentry></idxentry>

		</dd>

		<dt>
			<b>Save</b>
		</dt>

		<dd>After creating a new equation, the Save option is
initially disabled.  For the first Save, you must choose the format
for the output by using <a href="saveasapplet.html#saveasapplet">Save As HTML
Applet</a>, <a href="saveasimage.html#saveasimage">Save As Image</a>, or <a href="saveasmathml.html#saveasmathml">Save As MathML</a>.  After the first save,
however, the Save item will become active, and its label will change
to reflect the format you've choosen.  Selecting it from the menu will
continue to save the equation in the last selected format until you
change the format.
<idxentry></idxentry>

		</dd>

		<dt>
			<b>Quit</b>
		</dt>

		<dd>This option closes WebEQ Editor.  You will be prompted to save
your changes if you have edited the current equation since the last save.<idxentry></idxentry>
