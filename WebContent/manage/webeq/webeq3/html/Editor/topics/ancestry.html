<h1 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">The MathML Ancestry</h1>


<p>The MathML Ancestry is the status area displayed just below the
toolbar.  The Ancestry is there to show you at a glance the nesting of
the MathML structure at the cursor location, and to give you an easy
way to select parts of the equation containing the cursor.</p>


<idxentry xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance"></idxentry>


<p><img src="images/ancestry1.gif"></p>



<p>Since all MathML equations consist of templates nested inside a
&lt;math&gt; element, the ancestry always shows the &lt;math&gt; element on
the left.  Intermediate MathML templates are listed in order of
nesting, with the innermost MathML template or symbol at the cursor
location indicated on the far right.</p>



<p>When there are too many levels of nesting to display all at once, the Ancestry
shows dots on the right and/or left edge of the display.  Clicking on the
dots scrolls the display in the corresponding direction.</p>



<p>As you move the mouse, the Ancestry automatically updates to
reflect the nesting at the current cursor position.  Also, when you
select part of an equation in the editing area, the corresponding
template label in the Ancestry will be highlighted.</p>



<h2 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance">Making Selections from the Ancestry</h2>


<p>When you mouse over one of the MathML templates in the Ancestry, it
will become highlighted in red.  By clicking a highlighted template,
you can quickly and accurately select the corresponding part of the
equation in the WebEQ Editor window.</p>


<idxentry xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/XMLSchema-instance"></idxentry>


<p>By double-clicking an Ancestry label, you can highlight the
corresponding area of the current equation and simultaneously open the
default Properties panel for the selection.  Each kind of MathML
template has a default Properties panel, depending on what MathML
properties it supports.  Since changes to a Properties panel only
affect the current selection, this is a very convenient way to edit
properties.  See <a href="propmenu.html#propmenu">How Properties Work</a> for
more details.</p>

<p>When a selection contains several kinds of templates, so that
several Properties panels would apply, you have to open the other
Properties panels  by hand from the Properties menu.  Only the default
panel can be opened by double-clicking.</p>
